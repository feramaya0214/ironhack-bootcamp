<!-- # Lab Review -->

## Learning Goals

After this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain the key concepts from the previous day's lab and lessons
- Independently complete any remaining lab iterations

<br>



## Introduction

In this session, the teaching staff will facilitate a lab review where you and your classmates will have an opportunity to review and discuss the concepts from the previous day's lab and lessons. 

This is a great opportunity to share your work, ask questions, and collaborate with your classmates. To get the most out of this activity, be sure to participate as much as possible and share your insights!





## Lab Review

During the lab review, the instructor will ask you and your classmates to share your approach to solving the lab iterations, help answer any questions you might have, and provide advice on best practices and approaches for solving problems.



The process of reviewing the lab will be done one iteration at a time and will have two main objectives:

- Review the core concepts covered in the iteration
- Answer any questions related to those concepts



For each iteration, the instructor will:

1. Select a student or a team to share their code and explain their solution (max 5 minutes).

2. If iteration is not solved, show how to solve the iteration.

3. Answer any questions and clarify any concepts that might still be unclear.



<br>

The instructor will repeat this process for as many iterations as possible during the lab review time.

We encourage you to participate in the lab review and share your ideas and suggestions. 

If you have any questions or need help understanding concepts, please don't hesitate to ask the instructor for clarification.
