<!-- # Project Code Review and Collaboration -->

## Objective

In this collaborative learning session, we will engage in a project code review to foster a deeper understanding of code quality, teamwork, and effective communication within the context of real-world projects. This activity will encourage students to reflect on their coding practices and offer constructive feedback to their peers. 

### Activity Overview

- **Duration:** 3 hours (flexible timing)

### Activity Structure

1. **Preparation (15 minutes):**
   - Each group gathers and prepares a brief summary of their project.
   - Teams organize their code for review and make sure it's accessible to the other group.

2. **Code Review Phase (90 minutes):**
   - Each group conducts a code review of another group's project, and vice versa. The reviewing and reviewed groups are determined based on the number of participating groups, ensuring that each group has an opportunity to both review and be reviewed by their peers.
   - During the review, each group focuses on identifying strengths and areas for improvement in their peer's project.
   - Participants should design a review template to structure their feedback.
   - Using the project rubric is encouraged.

3. **Break (15 minutes):**
   - A short break for participants to relax and recharge.

4. **Discussion Phase (45 minutes):**
   - All participating groups come together for a constructive discussion.
   - Each group shares their findings and feedback on the other's code.
   - Discuss what went well in the code and what aspects could be improved.
   - Encourage open and respectful communication.

5. **Breakout Group Discussions (30 minutes):**
   - Participants split into smaller breakout groups.
   - Within these groups, they reflect on the feedback received and prioritize areas for improvement.
   - Brainstorm solutions and strategies for enhancing their coding practices.

6. **Final Discussion (30 minutes):**
   - Groups reconvene and share the outcomes of their smaller group discussions.
   - Discuss strategies for implementing improvements in future projects.
   - Summarize key takeaways and lessons learned.

### Key Benefits

- Enhances code quality through peer evaluation.
- Fosters effective communication and teamwork.
- Encourages reflection and self-improvement.
- Provides a real-world perspective on coding practices.
