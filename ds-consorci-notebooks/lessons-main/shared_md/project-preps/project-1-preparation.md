<!-- ## Week 3 Project Preparation -->

In order to hit the ground running for the module 1 project next week, it is recommended that you begin to think about what you might want to do for it. The reason for this is because in the module 1 project, you are able to choose your own topic and area of exploration. By starting this process before Monday, you can have some more time to think about topics you are passionate about and start some of the research work.

This is recommended as it may prove challenging for to find datasets, APIs or websites to scrape for your chosen topic. If you are able to discover this before Monday then you can choose a different topic. The module 1 project will also take place in pairs, so you can also look for a partner this week that might want to work on a similar topic as you.

Some suggested steps you can take this week:

- Think about a topic to work on in the module 1 project.
- Look for a peer that might also want to work on a similar topic.
- Search for available APIs, websites or datasets for the chosen topic.
