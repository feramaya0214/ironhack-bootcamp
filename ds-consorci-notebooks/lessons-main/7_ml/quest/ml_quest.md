## Introduction

Welcome to your Machine Learning project! This week, you'll be diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, applying and expanding upon everything you've learned so far. This project is designed to be both a challenge and a learning opportunity, allowing you to explore new concepts such as supervised learning, feature engineering and more. The aim is to learn and apply new techniques you learn in the week, as well as building on what you already know.

## Setup

You will be working individually or pairs for this project, your lead teacher will let you know the setup. To manage your project efficiently, it is recommend to set up a [Kanban board](https://trello.com/). This will help you organize tasks, set deadlines, and divide the workload effectively.

## Brief

You are free to choose any topic for your Machine Learning model. The goal is to predict an outcome based on the data you select. For example, you could develop a model that predicts the performance of a football player based on their past games, or you could make a model to predict the likelihood of a social media post going viral based on engagement rates. Be creative but also realistic in what you aim to achieve within the given timeframe!

## **Typical Day**

Your project work is scheduled for the afternoons. The structure is designed to give you ample time to apply the morning's lessons to your project. In the final days of the project week, you will have full days to polish your work and prepare for the final presentation.

### **Day 1: Topic Selection and Data Acquisition**

- If you haven’t already, choose a topic for your Machine Learning project.
- Find and acquire relevant data. Ensure the data is sufficient and suitable for your chosen topic.

### **Day 2: Data Preparation**

- Clean and wrangle your data to make it suitable for Machine Learning models.
- Begin feature engineering to enhance your model's predictive capabilities.

### **Day 3: Model Development and Initial Tuning**

- Develop your initial Machine Learning model.
- Start fine-tuning your model using techniques like Grid Search and Cross-Validation.

### **Day 4: Advanced Modeling**

- Experiment with more powerful models, such as Ensemble models.
- Continue to refine and enhance your model's performance.
- Create and prepare project presentation.

## Deliverables:

Your main deliverable is a GitHub repository named after your project theme. It should include:

- A comprehensive **`README.md`** that describes your project, data sources, Machine Learning techniques used, and key findings.
- A Jupyter notebook (or notebooks) containing your analysis, code, and visualizations. The narrative should guide the reader through your process and findings.
- Python scripts used for data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and tuning.
- Any datasets used (if publicly shareable) or a description of how to access them.
- Presentation slides summarizing your project's objective, methodology, findings, and conclusions.

## Coding Best practices

- **Modularize Code**:
    - For Python: Create reusable functions and classes, and place them in separate `.py` files. Import them into your notebooks or main scripts to maintain a clean and organized codebase.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. The same applies for the database, tables and columns naming. Follow language-specific naming conventions to enhance readability.
- **Remove Unused Code**: Eliminate any unused imports, variables, or lines of code/queries. Keep the codebase clean and focused on what is necessary.
- **Comments and Documentation**: Add meaningful comments and documentation to explain complex or crucial parts of the code. It aids understanding and future maintenance.
- **Logical Organization**: Group related functionalities together and maintain a coherent flow within your scripts or notebooks.
- **Regular Refactoring**: Review and refactor the code periodically to remove redundancies, enhance efficiency, and ensure alignment with current best practices and project needs.

## **Rubric**

In order to assess your project and ensure all requirements are met, a **rubric** will be used. This rubric is used to **evaluate your project** by your teaching staff but also to **communicate** what constitutes incomplete, acceptable and excellent performance across each of the learning outcomes for the project. Take some time to review the rubric that is in Student Portal and ask your teacher any questions about it if necessary.

## Tips & Tricks for Success

- Choose the data sources and topic for your project ASAP and try to stick to the plan. Don't switch halfway through the week.
- Break the project down into small steps. Many smaller, simple tasks are better than a single complicated one.
- Work through and review the lessons in class to consolidate knowledge.
- Add relevant code to your project each day to maintain progress throughout the week.
- Commit early, commit often and don’t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
- Name your commits well so your teammates know what everyone is working on.

## The Presentation:

You will present your mini project on Friday morning to the class showcasing your project as well as a short presentation in the form of some slides. You should present your findings to the class in a visually appealing, easily understandable manner. The format of the presentation will be as follows:

- Talking with Slides: 8 **minutes**
- Total: **10 minutes**

All presentations will be done **from a staff member’s computer**, so **your slides need to be online**. PowerPoint files, Keynote files or files of any kind **will not be accepted**.

- Suggested online slide applications:
    - **[Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)**
    - **[Slides](https://slides.com/)**
    - **[Prezi](https://prezi.com/)**
