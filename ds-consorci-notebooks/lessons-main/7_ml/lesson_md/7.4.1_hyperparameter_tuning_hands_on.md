<!-- # Lesson: Hyperparameter Tuning -->
## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this lesson, you will be able to:
  
- Optimize machine learning models by adjusting hyperparameters to achieve peak performance.
- Describe the concepts and differences between Grid Search and Random Search in the context of hyperparameter optimization.
- Analyze the impact of different hyperparameters on model performance and interpret their interactions.


## Hands on Lesson

The Jupyter Notebook with empty code cells so you can do Code Along can be found here: **[Hyperparameter Tuning Code Along](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/lessons/blob/main/7_ml/code_along_nb/7.4_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb)**

The complete Jupyter Notebook that will be used through out the Hands On Lesson can be found here: **[Hyperparameter Tuning ](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/lessons/blob/main/7_ml/7.4_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb)**
