<!-- # Lesson: Feature Engineering -->
## Learning Outcomes
  
Upon completion of this lesson, you will be able to:
  
- Describe the significance of feature engineering in the machine learning pipeline and its impact on model performance.
- Implement various preprocessing techniques, including scaling features and encoding categorical variables, to prepare data for modeling.
