## Introduction

Welcome to IronKaggle Competition: Predictive Sales Modeling Challenge!

Today's challenge is all about using your Machine Learning skills to predict sales for various stores. You and your partner will work together to write code and build the best model. With your LT and TA unavailable, it's up to you to make your model shine!

## Overview

### Pair Programming

In this competition, teamwork is important. Paired with your fellow competitor, you must work together to understand the data and create a good model. Every choice you make, every line of code you write, affects how well your model performs. Choose wisely, because winning depends on how well you work together.


### Dataset

Here's the dataset you'll be working with:

   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/data-bootcamp-v4/data/main/sales.csv

Metadata:
- **shop_ID:** Unique identifier for each shop.
- **day_of_the_week:** Encoded from 1 to 7, representing the day of the week.
- **date:** Day, month, and year of the data point.
- **number_of_customers:** Quantity of customers that visited the shop on that day.
- **open:** Binary variable; 0 means the shop was closed, while 1 means it was open.
- **promotion:** Binary variable; 0 means no promotions, 1 means there were promotions.
- **state_holiday:** Encoded as 0, 'a', 'b', 'c', indicating the presence of a state holiday (0 if none). 'a', 'b', 'c' represent different state holidays.
- **school_holiday:** Binary variable; 0 means no school holiday, 1 means there was a school holiday.


### Deliverables

**The Race Against Time: Predictive Modeling Awaits**
You'll need to work quickly to build your predictive model. At 16:00, a new dataset(without target variable, you can find it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/data-bootcamp-v4/data/main/ironkaggle_notarget.csv)
) will be revealed, and you'll use your model to predict sales. Get ready, collaborate with your partner, and let's make some magic happen!


By 17:00, predictions for the new dataset must be delivered, for you LT/TA to compare your predictions with the real label
