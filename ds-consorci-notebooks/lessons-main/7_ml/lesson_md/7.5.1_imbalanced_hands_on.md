<!-- # Lesson: Imbalanced -->
## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this lesson, you will be able to:
  
- Implement strategies to address class imbalance in machine learning models to improve performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and overall predictive power.
- Evaluate the impact of class imbalance on bias and discrimination in machine learning models and apply techniques to mitigate these issues.
