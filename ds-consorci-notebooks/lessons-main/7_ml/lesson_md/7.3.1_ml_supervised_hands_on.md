<!-- # Lesson: Supervised Learning -->
## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this lesson, you will be able to:
  
- Identify the structure of several popular classification and regression algorithms.
- Explain the data processing mechanisms of these algorithms in solving classification and regression problems, including their strengths and weaknesses.


## Hands on Lesson
