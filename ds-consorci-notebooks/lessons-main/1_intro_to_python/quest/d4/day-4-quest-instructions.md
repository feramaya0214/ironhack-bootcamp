<!-- # Testing & finishing the quest -->

## Introduction

Welcome to Day 4! Today's focus is on finishing the game and mastering the art of efficient code with list and dictionary comprehensions. Also, delve into the world of Python testing to ensure your code is error-free. Remember that if you have completed all of the deliverables for the game you may add some additional features as defined in the project brief if you have time.

Finally, you will work on the presentation of the quest that will be presented tomorrow. It is up to you how to organize your team to prepare the presentation throughout the afternoon depending on your progress so far. One suggestion is to split up the teams so that one person from the Dev and Research Team work together in part 1 to start the presentation, and then as a whole group in part 3 to finish and refine and finish it.

## Daily Overview & Schedule

### Part 1: Development & Research Hour (pairs) | 14:00 - 15:00

Switch roles again and dive into game development and focused research.

### Part 2: Knowledge Exchange (full group) | 15:00 - 15:30

Share your progress and learnings with your teammates, enhancing collective understanding (15 mins per group).

**Dev Team:**

- Discuss your implementation of the game code. Highlight any challenges faced and how you overcame them.

**Research Team:**

- Share your insights on list and dictionary comprehensions, and how they can enhance code efficiency.
- Discuss Python testing methodologies learned and how they can ensure a bug-free game.

### Part 3: Testing Phase (full group) | 15:30 - 16:30

Apply your newfound knowledge to the game, ensuring it's both efficient and bug-free.

**Research Team:**

- Apply list and dictionary comprehensions to the game code, improving its efficiency.
- Test your code thoroughly to ensure the game works as expected.

**Dev Team:**

- Test the changes made by the Research team, validating code efficiency and functionality.
- Provide support and challenge the Research team in their attempts to streamline the code and test it.

Don't forget to communicate, save your work often, and refresh your work on Google Colab. Let's make Day 4 productive!
