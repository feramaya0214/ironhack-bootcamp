    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is known for its readability and simplicity. However, as programs become more complex, it's essential to follow certain practices to ensure that your Python code is clean, readable, and maintainable. This lesson will cover these practices and offer some insights into writing better Python code.\n",

    "## Understanding Python style guide\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP 8 is a particular proposal that outlines the style guide for Python code. It was written to guide Python developers in creating code that's easy to read and consistent with the rest of the Python community. Some of its main recommendations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indentation level.\n",
    "- **Line Length:** Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.\n",
    "- **Blank Lines:** Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\n",
    "- **Imports:** Always put import statements at the top of the file. They should be on separate lines.\n",
    "- **Naming conventions**: Follow specific naming conventions such as using lowercase letters with words separated by underscores for functions, variables, and modules.\n",
    "- **Whitespaces**: Use spaces around operators and after commas to improve code clarity. Avoid unnecessary whitespace within parentheses or brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read the entire **[PEP 8 Style Guide](https://pep8.org/)** for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the example below that uses these recommendations.\n",

    "\n",
    "The way you write and structure your code can have a big impact on its readability. Here are some practices to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Descriptive Names:** Variable, function, and class names should be descriptive and use the snake_case naming style. Avoid using single-letter variable names, unless in very short block codes where the variable has no real meaning.\n",
    "- **Use Comments Wisely:** While it's important to comment your code, don't overdo it. Comments should explain why something is done, not what is done. Python code should be self-explanatory.\n",
    "- **Stay Consistent:** If you choose a way to do something, stick with it. Consistency makes your code easier to read and understand.\n",
