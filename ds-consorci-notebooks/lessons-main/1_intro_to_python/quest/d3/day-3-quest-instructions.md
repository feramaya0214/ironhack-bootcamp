<!-- # Day 3: Refining Functions & Coding Best Practices -->

## Introduction

Welcome to Day 3! Today, refine your functions, boost game dynamics to make it more interactive. On the research front learn about best coding practices, and focus on clean, readable, well-documented code.

## Daily Overview & Schedule

### Part 1: Collaborative Development & Research Hour (pairs) | 14:00 - 15:00

Swap roles and dive into refining your game and conducting research.

**Dev Team:**

- Further refine functions and flow control.
- Enhance game complexity and interactivity.
- Test new features to ensure smooth game experience.

**Research Team:**

- Read lesson in student portal: **Modules and packages**
- Learn how to import Python modules and packages.
- Learn how to import your own Python (.py) files and understand the structure of modular code.

### Part 2: Interactive Knowledge Exchange (full group) | 15:00 - 15:30

Once again, it's time to share your findings and progress with the rest of the team.

**Dev Team:**

- Share your progress on refining the game's functions and enhancing its interactivity.
- Discuss any new features added and the challenges faced during this process.

**Research Team:**

- Share the key points of your research on Python modules and packages.
- Explain the process of importing Python (.py) files and how modular code structure can benefit the game development.

### Part 3: Application & Testing Phase (full group) | 15:30 - 16:30

In the final part of the day, you'll apply your newfound knowledge to the game and test any modifications you've made.

**Research Team:**

- Based on your research, suggest potential ways to modularize the game code for better organization and management.
- Move your functions to separate Python (.py) files for better organization and maintainability. Import the functions into your Google Colab notebook to keep the notebook clean and concise.

**Dev Team:**

- Test the changes made by the Research team to ensure they meet the expected standards.
- Support and challenge the Research team during this process, ensuring the game code remains clean, efficient, and well-documented.

Remember to communicate with your team members, make frequent saves, and refresh your work on Google Colab to ensure everyone is updated. Have a productive Day 3!
