 ## Activity Types
 
The different types of activities happening this week are:

### Daily Kick Off

The daily kick off is the first activity of each day, designed to set the stage for the day's learning activities. It typically includes a brief overview of the day's objectives, a recap of the previous day, and a preview of new topics to be covered.

### Group Lab Review / Morning Review

The lab/morning reviews are interactive sessions, and should last no longer than 45 minutes. The LT or TA leads the session and asks for students input on how to solve the lab from the previous day. It serves as a collaborative exercise for students to revisit, understand, and solve the lab tasks with guidance from the teaching team. These reviews are instrumental in reinforcing key concepts and honing problem-solving skills.

In order to engage students, you may call on volunteers or select students to solve each iteration. For more complex questions where there are multiple possible solutions, it may be useful to ask other students if they have solved the iteration in a different way. Having said this, it’s important to keep track of time and try to get through as many of the iterations as possible by around 9:50 so students can have a small break before classes begin.

At the end of the session, the lab solutions should be shared with students so they can check their work independently as well.

### Lessons

Lessons are focused, instructor-led session, typically lasting between 45 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, designed to introduce new concepts or skills as part of the curriculum. Teaching strategies such as direct instruction, demonstrations, code-alongs and active learning activities to engage students may be used to facilitate understanding and application. LTs manage Q&A as part of the lesson time.

Lessons should take place in the morning, by 13:00, including time for questions and breaks. With larger cohorts, it might be easier to make time for questions at key moments during the session when a topic has been covered in order to keep the time for questions time-boxed. If questions begin to stray into areas that are outside of the curriculum and is delaying the class, encourage students to find answers on their own with Google and the Ironhack ChatBot or in a break.

### Quests

Quests may span from a single afternoon to a full week (afternoons only) and involve students applying knowledge from lectures on a daily basis. In week 1 the quest covers basic Python through creating an “Escape Room” game. The aim is to help students build familiarity with basic Python and start the bootcamp with a collaborative mindset through working in a group.

Students will work in groups of 4 (2 pairs formed of a “research” and “dev” team) to build the project. Their roles will rotate daily and they will have to work as a team to complete the tasks for each day. Full details and the brief for the quest is found in the “Quest: Escape Room” card in the student portal.

In some cases, the number of students in a group will have to change from 4 to 3 in order to accommodate the size of the cohort. For instance, if there are 27 students, there would be 6 groups of 4 and one group of 3. If there are 13 students it would make sense to have 3 groups of 3 and one group of 4. In the group of 4, the roles rotate daily between the research and dev team but in a group of 3, the recommended set up is as follows (always two students on the dev team):

- Day 1: Student A & Student B: Dev Team | Student C: Research Team
- Day 2: Student B & Student C: Dev Team | Student A: Research Team
- Day 3: Student C & Student A: Dev Team | Student B: Research Team
- Day 4: Student A & Student B: Dev Team | Student C: Research Team

In order for students to have the best learning experience, it would be ideal to have groups of students based on ability. In some cases it could be beneficial to group students by mixed ability but in other cases it could be preferred to group students of similar levels of ability. However, knowing what would be best relies on deeper knowledge of the students in the cohort and their ability levels.

Since this is week 1, it will be hard to determine since the has not been the opportunity to get to know students and what their level is and how they might work and collaborate with others. As a result, grouping the students randomly or based on prework performance is recommended for week 1. Throughout the week there is the opportunity for the teaching team to monitor how students perform and work with others in order to form groups for following quests and projects.

*Note : students could complete mini projects and projects individually, subject to agreement with the Lead Teacher. This is to accommodate diverse learning preferences, individual strengths or project topic preference.*

### Labs

Labs are daily, hands-on activities that students may complete individually or in pairs that allow them to apply knowledge from lectures. Labs are formed of iterations that cover the minimum requirements for completion, and often “bonus” iterations that covering more advanced concepts and content.

Labs have been scoped to fit into the 1 hour time-frame, however there may be students that finish much faster or slower depending on their ability. For the students that finish faster, there are extra labs marked as “extra” in the student portal. These extra labs cover the same topics but are longer and more detailed. For students that are slower, they can continue working on the lab after the daily wrap up, before the lab review the following day.

### Daily Wrap Up

The daily wrap up is the the concluding session of the day, offering an opportunity to summarize and reflect on the day's learning. It often involves reviewing key points from the day's lessons, addressing any lingering questions, and previewing the next day's agenda. Students may be asked to reflect on key learnings, and share their progress on labs and projects and significant milestones they may have reached.

This could be a good opportunity for each group to share how they progressed in the quest, and a chance for students from other groups to interact and ask how they solved a particular problem.

### Assessment

Assessments are graded evaluations conducted via the Qualified platform, aimed at testing students' understanding and application of key concepts learned during the bootcamp. Students are tasked with solving problems, providing tangible evidence of their proficiency in the subject matter. The graded results offer feedback, helping instructors identify areas of strength and improvement.

The week 1 assessment (M1 | Python (202303)) covers the following topics:

- Data types and structures
- Functions
- Methods and functions for different data types/structures
- Slicing and indexing
- If/else statements and loops

The time limit for the assessment is 180 minutes, and the cut score is 60%.

The recommended time for students to complete the assessment is Friday afternoon. Having said this, students may be tired at the end of the week, especially as it has been their first week and have been working hard on a quest. As a result, the Friday afternoon can be reserved for extra revision and independent review of materials if students don’t feel like taking the assessment. However, if they choose to do this then the assessment will have to be completed during the weekend as homework before the start of week 2.

Some students may feel stressed about the assessment activities and in these cases it is important to reinforce that the assessment results have no impact on their graduation from Ironhack, and are a tool for learning. For the LT and TA the assessment results should indicate the overall level of the class and highlight and topics that students may need to review in some more detail.

### Weekly Wrap Up

During this activity it is a chance for the entire class to reflect on the week led by a member of the teaching team. Suggested points of discussion to ask students include:

- What your greatest learnings were
- What were some challenges you faced
- Which topics are you finding difficult or need to spend more time reviewing
- How you found the lessons
- How you found the labs
- How you found the quest

To facilitate the session students could be asked to record their reflections on a “sprint board” for the first 5-10 minutes and then review as a class for the remainder of the
session. Some suggested tools for the activity include:

- [Miro](https://miro.com/app/)
- [Mural](https://www.mural.co/)
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)

## Weekly Overview

### Learning Goals

By the end of the week, students should be able to:

- Identify and use different data types such as integer, float, string, and boolean and select the appropriate data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and sets for specific problems, manipulating them using indexing, slicing, and built-in methods.
- Define functions, manage variable scopes and lifetimes within functions, and effectively call and pass arguments to functions in Python.
- Use conditional statements, such as if-else statements, to execute different blocks of code based on a condition, and use loops, such as for and while loops, to iterate over a sequence or collection of elements.
- Identify, handle and recover from potential errors in Python code using try-except blocks and apply appropriate error handling techniques to improve code reliability and maintainability.
- Write and execute Python programs using simple, short and optimized syntax such as list, set, dict comprehension, lambda functions and concatenating methods.
- Use built-in Python functions and libraries to manipulate data and perform calculations.
- Utilize Pandas data structures, such as dataframes and series, and be able to create, read, and manipulate them using functions and methods such as apply and applymap with lambda functions and loc or iloc.
- Explain the core concepts of object-oriented programming in Python, including classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

### Guidelines

**Monday**

As Monday is the first day of the bootcamp, there will be some activities in the morning such as a campus tour and presentation by the PM. Ideally the classes should start not later than 10:30, so that there is enough time for the weekly kick off and prework review.

We recommend you start having a brief discussion on why Python, before diving into the lecture.

In the weekly kick off it’s important to give an overview of the setup of the week (lead teacher-led classes in the morning and TA/CTA facilitated and supported group activities in the afternoon) to set the right expectations. It would also be a good opportunity to introduce the Ironhack ChatBot and the ticketing system for methods in how students receive support at the end of the presentation. This could include a quick demo of the chatbot and highlighting the key use cases in the chatbot lesson.

During the weekly kick off a short introduction to the quest is also necessary. This can be done using the slides in the presentation. Students will also be required to read and understand the brief in the first activity in the afternoon, so any additional questions should be answered by the TA/CTA.

The prework review sessions will be a good chance to interact with students and get a sense of how much they have absorbed key concepts from the prework. If you identify any particularly strong/weak students that you feel should be in different groups for the quest, then you can change them if necessary.

**Labs**

Each of the labs are built on top of each other, so they should be completed sequentially in the order shown in the calendar. The lab solution should be shared after the lab review the following morning so students can review the solution and continue working as extra practice.

**Lessons**

Lessons are built on top of each other. For example, the flow control lesson relies on knowledge of data structures, and for functions knowledge of flow control and data structures, and so on.

Functions is split over two days and has the same Jupyter notebook. The reason for this is because 1 hour is not enough time to cover everything and having the content distributed over two days allows students to have enough of an understanding of the basics and to work on the quest and meet its requirements.

If it proves difficult to teach everything in the week, OOP and Error Handling are the topics that can be left out to allow time to focus on everything else. When teaching OOP, it is recommended to teach only the first section until “defining our own class”. This is so students build familiarity with the basic concepts of attribute and method, and are able to understand the differences with functions when working throughout the bootcamp.

## FAQ

<summary style="font-size: 16px">What to do if there are students of very different ability levels of ability that are impacting the group work?</summary>

You can try to promote peer tutoring in the group setting if there are students of varying abilities. Encourage the more advanced student to take on a mentorship or tutor role. This can help the less advanced student catch up, while also reinforcing the understanding of the advanced student as they explain concepts to their peer. It's important to ensure that the advanced student doesn't just do the work for the other student, but helps them understand.
