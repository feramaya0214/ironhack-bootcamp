## Introduction

In week 7, daily activities are typically split up by morning lead teacher led classes and hands-on peer work in the afternoons (labs and the mini projects). In the “Activity Types” section there are descriptions and high level directions for the different activities. In the Weekly Overview section, you will find more specific recommendations and tips for different lessons and the mini project.

## Activity Types

The different types of activities happening this week are:

### Daily Kick Off

This is the initial session of each day, designed to set the stage for the day's learning activities. It typically includes a brief overview of the day's objectives, a recap of the previous day, and a preview of new topics to be covered.

### Group Lab Review / Morning Review

These are interactive sessions, and should last no longer than 45 minutes. The LT or TA leads the session and asks for students input on how to solve the lab from the previous day. It serves as a collaborative exercise for students to revisit, understand, and solve the lab tasks with guidance from the teaching team. These reviews are instrumental in reinforcing key concepts and honing problem-solving skills.

In order to engage students, you may call on volunteers or select students to solve each iteration. For more complex questions where there are multiple possible solutions, it may be useful to ask other students if they have solved the iteration in a different way. Having said this, it’s important to keep track of time and try to get through as many of the iterations as possible by around 9:50 so students can have a small break before classes begin.

At the end of the session, the lab solutions should be shared with students so they can check their work independently as well.

### Lessons

This is a focused, instructor-led session, typically lasting between 45 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, designed to introduce new concepts or skills as part of the curriculum. Teaching strategies such as direct instruction, demonstrations, code-alongs and active learning activities to engage students may be used to facilitate understanding and application. LTs manage Q&A as part of the lesson time.

Lessons should take place in the morning, by 13:00, including time for questions and breaks. With larger cohorts, it might be easier to make time for questions at key moments during the session when a topic has been covered in order to keep the time for questions time-boxed. If questions begin to stray into areas that are outside of the curriculum and is delaying the class, encourage students to find answers on their own with Google and the Ironhack ChatBot or in a break.

### Mini Projects

Mini projects may span from a single afternoon to a full week (afternoons only) and involve students applying knowledge from lectures on a daily basis. In week 7 the mini project covers Machine Learning. Students will be required to create a predictive model on their own in dataset of their choice.

Students will work in pairs for this mini project and are required to self-organize and divide tasks amongst themselves.

Full details and brief for the mini project is found in the *ML Mini Project* card in the student portal.

In order for students to have the best learning experience, it would be ideal to have groups of students based on ability. In some cases it could be beneficial to group students by mixed ability or by grouping students of similar levels of ability. As students have freedom to create/choose their own dataset, students may also want to work with someone that would like to explore a similar topic to them.

You may choose to decide to group students however you feel is most suited to the cohort.

*Note : students could complete mini projects and projects individually, subject to agreement with the Lead Teacher. This is to accommodate diverse learning preferences, individual strengths or project topic preference.*

### Labs

Daily, hands-on activities that students may complete individually or in pairs that allow them to apply knowledge from lectures. Labs are formed of iterations that cover the minimum requirements for completion, and often “bonus” iterations that covering more advanced concepts and content.

Labs have been scoped to fit into the 1 hour time-frame, however you may have students that finish much faster or slower depending on their ability. For the students that finish faster, there might be bonus labs marked as “extra” in the student portal. These extra labs cover the same topics but are longer and more detailed. For students that are slower, they can continue working on the lab after the daily wrap up, before the lab review the following day.

### Daily Wrap Up

This is the concluding session of the day, offering an opportunity to summarize and reflect on the day's learning. It often involves reviewing key points from the day's lessons, addressing any lingering questions, and previewing the next day's agenda. Students may be asked to reflect on key learnings, and share their progress on labs and projects and significant milestones they may have reached.

This could be a good opportunity for each group to share how they progressed in the mini project, and a chance for students from other groups to interact and ask how they solved a particular problem.



### Weekly Wrap Up

During this activity it is a chance for the entire class to reflect on the week led by a member of the teaching team. Suggested points of discussion to ask students include:

- What your greatest learnings were
- What were some challenges you faced
- Which topics are you finding difficult or need to spend more time reviewing
- How you found the lessons
- How you found the labs
- How you found the mini project

To facilitate the session students could be asked to record their reflections on a “sprint board” for the first 5-10 minutes and then review as a class for the remainder of the
session. Some suggested tools for the activity include:

- [Miro](https://miro.com/app/)
- [Mural](https://www.mural.co/)
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)

## Weekly Overview

### Learning Goals

By the end of the week, students should be able to:

- Learn the basics of machine learning and supervised learning, understanding regression and classification concepts.
- Dive into basic models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression. Implement and evaluate these models.
- Explore more advanced models such as ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- Understand the importance of hyperparameters and techniques for tuning them.
- Dive into techniques for handling imbalanced datasets and implement them

### Guidelines

**Weekly Kick Off**

At the beginning of the week, use the following presentation to introduce the key topics of the week, the schedule and the mini project:

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQmVCPpaH2VabrbuAG1UDBXiXP9l7sEzmDOK9Vc_4zmsa-ibi4tnwn2LY9FkW6gmd1tDI-yAtpUsR84/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

**Note:** If formatting on Slides does not appear correct, you can use the [link of the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jGZROH6XLOVy3qHjWem2qn5Uv5G6l1aMY5BXmpI8pEc/edit#slide=id.g117c195af3d_0_0) here.

**Labs**

Throughout the labs, students will work with the Spaceship Titanic dataset as a running example. Each session will introduce new techniques, allowing students to gradually implement them into their predictive models and refine their approach day by day.

**Lessons**

The ML **lessons are built on top of each other** and should be delivered **sequentially**.

This is a focused, instructor-led session, typically lasting between 45 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, designed to introduce new concepts or skills as part of the curriculum. Teaching strategies such as direct instruction, demonstrations, code-alongs and active learning activities to engage students may be used to facilitate understanding and application. LTs manage Q&A as part of the lesson time.

Lessons should take place in the morning, by 13:00, including time for questions and breaks. With larger cohorts, it might be easier to make time for questions at key moments during the session when a topic has been covered in order to keep the time for questions time-boxed. If questions begin to stray into areas that are outside of the curriculum and is delaying the class, encourage students to find answers on their own with Google and the Ironhack ChatBot or in a break.

**Mini Project**

In Week 7 mini-project, students need to pick a dataset and make a prediction model. They can choose any topic or model they like. But they should pick the right features, maybe make them comparable, try different model combinations, and make sure their model works well by adjusting it carefully. Basically, they should use what they've learned during the week to make their prediction model better.


**Mini Project Presentations**

As this Mini Project is completed in pairs, there has been more time reserved on the Friday morning for presentations. It is recommended to begin the day with the presentations (from 9:00) in order to have enough time for the activity (Ironkaggle) that follow (from 10:30 - 13:00). However, the total time of presentations for students will depend on the size of the cohort. What is important is that activity can begin at 10:30.


## FAQ

<details>
<summary style="font-size: 16px">What to do if a student finishes a lab really quickly?</summary>

If a student finishes a lab very quickly, they should attempt a lab marked as “extra” in the student portal and read through the extra lessons in the portal.

<details>
<summary style="font-size: 16px">What to do if there are students of very different ability levels of ability that are impacting the group work?</summary>

You can try to promote peer tutoring in the group setting if there are students of varying abilities. Encourage the more advanced student to take on a mentorship or tutor role. This can help the less advanced student catch up, while also reinforcing the understanding of the advanced student as they explain concepts to their peer. It's important to ensure that the advanced student doesn't just do the work for the other student, but helps them understand.
