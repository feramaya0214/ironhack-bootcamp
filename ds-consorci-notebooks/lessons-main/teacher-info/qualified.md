Prior to the Week 1 assessment, it's essential to guide your students by:

- **Reviewing the Platform**: Introduce the students to the platform they'll be using, highlighting the essential features and how they'll interact with it.
- **Explaining the Assessment**: Provide a clear and detailed explanation of what the assessment entails, including the tasks, objectives, and expectations.

During this initial guidance, make sure to emphasize the following key points:

- **Use Parameters as Given**: Encourage students not to overwrite the parameters inside the function, but to utilize them as provided.
- **Don't Change the Function Signature**: Explain the importance of maintaining the original function signature without any alterations.
- **Return What Is Required**: Stress the necessity of returning exactly what the function is asking for, adhering to the instructions.
- **Avoid Prints Inside the Function**: For best practices, instruct students not to leave print statements inside the function, as this can interfere with the evaluation process.
- **Reading Test Results**: Guide students on how to read the pass and fail messages, interpreting what they mean, and using them to refine their solutions.

In subsequent weeks, a review of the assessment alone should suffice, as students will have become more familiar with the platform and expectations.

To further aid your explanation, below is a [video tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EVyGs_s-Y1FMpcg-WGXNh3pqC48oDBzB/preview) designed to help you introduce the Qualified Platform to your students. It's an example from the Web Development bootcamp that you can replicate in Python, adapting the principles and practices to suit the programming language and course content. Feel free to use it as a reference, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or for additional support.
