## Overview

In this mini project you will dive into the world of SQL through creating and populating a database of your own and then extracting meaningful insights through SQL using queries and Python visualization techniques. You have the freedom to choose your own data, the sources it originates from, and the business case you wish to cater to.

## Setup

In this Mini Project you will work in pairs, and are required to organize how to divide tasks throughout the week.

## Brief

In this project, you'll start by selecting and exploring datasets of your choice from various sources like Kaggle, APIs, or through web scraping. If you choose to use more than one, ensure they complement each other for a cohesive analysis. You will then formulate hypotheses related to the datasets selected. The goal is to craft a narrative using the data. You'll sketch out an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) highlighting significant data fields and relationships, then proceed to create and populate a functional database. During the process, you will carry out data wrangling to clean your datasets and prepare them for analysis. You will use SQL to run queries, derive valuable insights, and summarize your findings. To conclude, you'll visualize the derived insights using Python libraries and compile a comprehensive report, encapsulating your data story from exploration to insights.

## Deliverables

The main deliverable is a GitHub repository with the name `sql-database`. It should contain the following:

- A [README.md](http://README.md) file in the root of the repository to document the project containing useful information about the project. Anyone that reads the README should be able to understand the project without having to look through all of the files.
- Code and files that demonstrate the data pipeline coverage of acquisition, transformation, loading, analysis, and reporting. This includes:
    - Database: The exported `.sql` file should be included with the final schema.
    - Entity relationship diagramÂ (ERD).
    - SQL Queries: A compilation of all SQL queries used during the project.
    - Python files. Remember, when using Python the code must be put in wrapped functions.
    - At least 1 Jupyter notebook containing the report in full with visualizations.
        - The report should be comprehensive and aesthetically pleasing, that narrates the story of your data in full. The report should combine text, clean code, meaningful outputs, and engaging visualizations to convey the derived insights and conclusions effectively.
        - Make sure to modularize your work. The Jupyter notebook report **must** be distinct from the code responsible for cleaning, acquiring, processing data, etc. Feel free to use multiple Jupyter notebooks, **`.py`** or **`.sql`** modules for this.
- URL of the slides for the presentation:
    - The presentation (see guidelines below) should summarize your insights and conclusions.
    - Remember to i**nclude your ERD diagram.** You should explain it during the presentation, and defend the decisions made.

### Minimum Requirements

    - Define at least two clear research questions or problem statements.
    - Analyze data effectively to address these questions, ensuring the results are presented in an understandable and coherent manner.
- **Data Acquisition:**
    - Utilize a minimum of two distinct sources for your data, such as CSV files, web scraping, or APIs.
- **Database Structure:**
    - Design a database incorporating a minimum of three tables.
    - Make sure to apply suitable primary and foreign keys and delineate the relationships between tables.
- **Data Management:**
    - Efficiently import data into your database using the right tools and methods.
    - Clean, format, restructure, and categorize the data to maintain consistency and accuracy.
- **Data Analysis:**
    - Craft at least five insightful SQL queries using fundamental clauses like GROUP BY, JOIN, and Subqueries.

    - For SQL: Use a local organization for `.sql` files.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. The same applies for the database, tables and columns naming. Follow language-specific naming conventions to enhance readability.
- **Remove Unused Code**: Eliminate any unused imports, variables, or lines of code/queries. Keep the codebase clean and focused on what is necessary.
- **Comments and Documentation**: Add meaningful comments and documentation to explain complex or crucial parts of the code. It aids understanding and future maintenance.
- **Logical Organization**: Group related functionalities together and maintain a coherent flow within your scripts or notebooks.
- **Regular Refactoring**: Review and refactor the code periodically to remove redundancies, enhance efficiency, and ensure alignment with current best practices and project needs.

## Rubric

In order to assess your project and ensure all requirements are met, a **rubric** will be used. This rubric is used to **evaluate your project** by your teaching staff but also to **communicate** what constitutes incomplete, acceptable and excellent performance across each of the learning outcomes for the project. Take some time to review the rubric that is in Student Portal and ask your teacher any questions about it if necessary.

## Tips & Tricks for Success

- Choose the data sources ASAP and try to stick to the plan. Don't switch halfway through the week.
- Break the project down into small steps. Many smaller, simple tasks are better than a single complicated one.
- Work through and review the lessons in class to consolidate knowledge.
- Add relevant code to your project each day to maintain progress throughout the week.
- Commit early, commit often and donât be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
- Name your commits well so your teammates know what everyone is working on.
