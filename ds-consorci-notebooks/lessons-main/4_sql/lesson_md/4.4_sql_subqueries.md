<!-- # SQL Subqueries and Set Operations -->

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Apply subqueries within various sections of SQL statements effectively.

## Subqueries

A subquery, also known as an inner query or nested query, is a SQL query embedded within a larger query. It allows you to utilize the results of a query as a condition in another query.  Subqueries allow you to perform complex operations by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.

Subqueries can be used with various SQL clauses including `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE`.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM tablename
WHERE column_name OPERATOR (SELECT column_name FROM tablename WHERE condition);
```

### Example

Given a table `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `employee_name`, and `salary`:

| employee_id | employee_name | salary  |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| 1           | John Doe      | 60000   |
| 2           | Jane Smith    | 55000   |
| 3           | Alice Jones   | 48000   |
| 4           | Bob Brown     | 52000   |


To find employees who earn more than the average salary:

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

**Resulting Set**:

| employee_name | salary  |
|---------------|---------|
| John Doe      | 60000   |
| Jane Smith    | 55000   |


### Key Points
  
- **Single vs Multiple Values**: Subqueries can return a single value (scalar), a single list of values, or a table.

- **Dependent vs Independent**: A subquery can be independent (it can run by itself) or correlated (it relies on the main query for its values).

### Types of Subqueries

#### 1. **Scalar Subqueries**

These return a single value. They can be used where single values are acceptable, like in the SELECT, WHERE, or HAVING clauses.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM tablename
WHERE column3 = (SELECT MAX(column3) FROM tablename);
```

##### Example

Using the same employee table. Find the employee with the maximum salary:

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
```

Resulting Set:

| employee_name | salary  |
|---------------|---------|
| John Doe      | 60000   |


#### 2. **Inline Views**

An inline view is a subquery in the FROM clause. It's used when the result set needs to be treated as a table.

```sql
SELECT a.column1, a.column2
FROM (SELECT column1, column2 FROM tablename WHERE condition) AS a
WHERE a.column1 = condition;
```

##### Example

Using the same employee table. Consider that we only want the names of the employees who have a salary greater than 50000, and then, from that result, we want to select those whose names start with 'J':

```sql
SELECT a.employee_name
FROM (SELECT employee_name FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000) AS a
WHERE a.employee_name LIKE 'J%';
```

Resulting Set:

| employee_name |
|---------------|
| John Doe      |
| Jane Smith    |


### Correlated vs. Non-Correlated Subqueries


#### Correlated Subqueries

A correlated subquery is evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query. It relies on inputs from the main query, making them interdependent.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM tablename a
WHERE column3 = (SELECT column3 FROM tablename b WHERE b.column1 = a.column1);
```

##### Example

Assume we have two tables, `employees` and `employee_bonus`. 

**Table `employee_bonus`**:

| employee_id | bonus_amount |
|-------------|--------------|
| 1           | 5000         |
| 3           | 3000         |

We want to find all employees who received a bonus.

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, e.salary
FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employee_bonus b WHERE b.employee_id = e.employee_id);
```

Resulting Set:

| employee_name | salary  |
|---------------|---------|
| John Doe      | 60000   |
| Alice Jones   | 48000   |


#### Non-Correlated Subqueries

A non-correlated subquery can be run independently of the main query. It returns data that the main query uses.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM tablename
WHERE column3 IN (SELECT column3 FROM another_tablename);
```

##### Example

From our `employees` table, we want to find those whose IDs are in the `employee_bonus` table:

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM employee_bonus);
```

Resulting Set:

| employee_name | salary  |
|---------------|---------|
| John Doe      | 60000   |
| Alice Jones   | 48000   |


### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

1. **Performance**: Correlated subqueries can be slow, especially on large datasets, because the subquery runs once for each row in the outer query.

2. **Readability**: Multiple nested subqueries can be hard to read. Use comments and appropriate formatting.

3. **Alternatives**: Sometimes JOINs or window functions can be used instead of subqueries for better performance and clarity.

4. **Testing**: Always test subqueries independently before integrating them into the main query.



## Summary

Subqueries and set operations are advanced SQL techniques that allow for more complex data retrieval and manipulation. Understanding these concepts enhances your ability to write efficient and flexible SQL queries, especially when dealing with multiple datasets or conditions.
