# Day 2 (Week 6)

For the project requirements and instructions for todayâ€™s tasks in full, please refer to the project brief. However, in order to keep on track you may refer to the daily goals outlined below:

By the end of the first two days, we recommend you have:

- Defined metrics of the A/B experiment you will visually present in Tableau
- Imported the cleaned and processed data into Tableau
- Created a dashboard showcasing the A/B test results, including completion rates, time spent on each step, error rates for both the Test and Control groups and/or any KPIs you've defined for this business case
- Used Tableau's filtering and drilling capabilities to allow viewers to explore data based on demographics, such as age groups or gender
- Incorporated visualizations from the EDA section to provide context
- Ensured your visualizations are clear, concise, and tell a compelling story about the experiment's results
