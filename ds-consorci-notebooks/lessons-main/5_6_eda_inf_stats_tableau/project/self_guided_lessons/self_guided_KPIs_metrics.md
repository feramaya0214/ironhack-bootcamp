### 1. Introduction to Metrics and KPIs:

In the world of business and data analytics, understanding performance is crucial. Two terms frequently used to assess and measure performance are "Metrics" and "Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)". While they might sound similar, they have distinct roles.

### 2. What are Metrics?

**Definition:** Metrics are quantifiable measures used to track and assess the status of a specific process.

**Characteristics of Metrics:**
- **Broad in Nature:** Metrics can be used across various facets of a business â€“ from marketing and sales to HR and operations.
- **Quantitative:** Metrics are always numeric.
- **Can be Passive:** Not all metrics directly drive action.

**Example:** The number of website visitors is a metric.

### 3. What are KPIs?

**Definition:** KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are specific metrics that are tied directly to strategic objectives.

**Characteristics of KPIs:**
- **Strategic:** Directly aligned with business goals.
- **Actionable:** They signal if corrective action is required.
- **Limited in Number:** Companies typically focus on a handful of KPIs to avoid being overwhelmed.

**Example:** If the business goal is to increase online sales, then the conversion rate (the percentage of website visitors that make a purchase) would be a KPI.
