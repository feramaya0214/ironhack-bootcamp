    "- **Lower Tail**: In the lower tail (left side of the plot), the data points lie below the red line. This indicates that the distribution of `SalePrice` has heavier tails on the lower side than the normal distribution.\n",
    "- **Upper Tail**: In the upper tail (right side of the plot), the data points deviate significantly from the red line, suggesting a long tail or skewness to the right. This indicates that there are more extreme high values in `SalePrice` than would be expected in a normal distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `SalePrice` data is not normally distributed. It appears to be right-skewed with potential outliers on the higher end and has heavier tails than a normal distribution. This could influence decisions about data transformations or the types of statistical methods applied to the data. For instance, a log transformation could be considered to address the skewness and make the data more normally distributed."
