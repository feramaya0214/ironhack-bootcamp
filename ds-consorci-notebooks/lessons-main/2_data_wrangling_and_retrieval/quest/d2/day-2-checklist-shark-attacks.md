For the project requirements in full, please refer to the project brief entitled, **Data Wrangling: Sharks**. However, in order to keep on track you may refer to the daily goals outlined below:

By the end of day, as a minimum you should have:

- Initiated the data cleaning process, focusing on non-date fields. This should include handling null values, removing duplicates, manipulating strings, and formatting the data.
- Implemented the use of Regular Expressions (Regex) in Python to clean and manipulate string data within the dataset.
- If dates are included in the analysis, implemented the use of proper date handling techniques.
