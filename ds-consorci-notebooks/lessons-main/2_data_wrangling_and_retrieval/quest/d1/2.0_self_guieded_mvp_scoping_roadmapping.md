<!-- # From Idea to Implementation: MVP, Scoping, and Roadmapping -->

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Explain what an MVP is and its importance in the data analytics project lifecycle.
- Scope a data analytics project effectively, distinguishing between what falls within and outside of the project's boundaries.
- Create a roadmap that outlines the timeline and milestones of a project.
- Apply these principles to a real-world data analytics project of your own.

## Introduction

In the world of data analytics, turning an abstract idea into actionable insights or a functioning model is an intricate process. It involves understanding what minimum viable product (MVP) is, effectively scoping your project, and creating a roadmap to guide the execution of the project. Each of these components plays a critical role in ensuring a successful outcome of your project.

## Understanding the MVP

The concept of a Minimum Viable Product, or MVP, is **a version of a new product that includes only the core features** necessary to meet the needs of its initial users. The final, complete set of features is only designed and developed after receiving feedback from the product's initial users. 

In data analytics, an MVP could be an initial model or analysis that provides valuable insights but is not yet fully optimized or scaled. 

### Example of an MVP in Data Analytics for Customer Behavior Analysis

Imagine you're creating a data analytics tool for online retailers to analyze customer behavior.

**MVP Features:**

- **Customer Data Integration**: Importing essential customer data like purchase history and basic demographics.
- **Basic Analytics Dashboard**: Providing visualizations of key metrics like sales trends, most popular products, customer segments, etc.

**Why These Features?**

The MVP focuses on core customer data and provides immediate value with a limited set of variables.

**Final Product Enhancements:**

As part of the final product, enhancements might include:

- **Including More Variables**: Expanding the analysis by incorporating additional variables like customer feedback, click-through rates, product reviews, etc.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Implementing real-time analytics to provide up-to-the-minute insights.
- **Automatically Updating Dashboard**: Creating a dashboard that automatically updates every specified number of minutes or hours, offering continuous visibility into key metrics.
- **External Data Integration**: Using APIs or web scraping to gather external data such as market trends, competitor pricing, social media sentiment, etc.
- **Advanced Analytics Models**: Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict future purchasing behavior, customer churn, etc.
- **Personalized Marketing Suggestions**: Analyzing customer preferences to suggest targeted marketing strategies.

**Why These Enhancements?**

The final product adds complexity by including more variables, real-time analytics, and an automatically updating dashboard. These provide a richer understanding of customer behavior and allow for sophisticated, timely decision-making.

## Project Scoping

Scoping is a technique for **defining the boundaries of a project**. It involves setting **clear objectives, identifying available and needed resources, defining key features of the project, setting priorities, and identifying constraints**. Scoping is crucial for ensuring everyone involved has a shared understanding of what the project will achieve and what it will entail.

Scoping in the example of the Customer Behavior Analysis platform would involve defining the specific parameters and constraints of the project. This includes determining which data will be used, such as focusing initially on the client's internal data and excluding external resources. The scope would also outline the creation of a basic analytics dashboard that might update once a week, rather than more frequent real-time updates. Other aspects of scoping might encompass identifying core features for the MVP, such as basic visualizations, while postponing more complex features like real-time analytics or an automatically updating dashboard for later stages. Budget considerations, timeline, success metrics, and potential risks would also be part of the scoping process. By setting these boundaries, scoping ensures that the project's goals are clear, achievable, and aligned with the resources available, guiding the project from conception to completion in a structured and realistic manner.

## Roadmapping

A project roadmap is a strategic tool that lays out the direction and timeline of the project. It's a high-level overview that illustrates the project's vision and major deliverables over time.  In data analytics, a roadmap might include data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, statistical analysis, insights derivation, and report creation. In data science, a roadmap might include data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model development, model testing, and model deployment. Having a well-defined roadmap helps in setting expectations, managing stakeholders, identifying key milestones, and monitoring progress. Without a roadmap, a project can quickly become disorganized and directionless, leading to inefficient use of resources and, ultimately, failure to achieve the project's goals.

## Applying MVP, Scoping, and Roadmapping to Data Analytics Projects

Using these three tools—MVP, scoping, and roadmapping—allows data analysts to work in a structured, focused manner. Starting with an MVP allows for quick testing and iteration, which can save time and resources in the long run. Scoping ensures that the project stays focused and manageable, increasing the chances of its successful completion. Finally, a roadmap keeps everyone on the same page and moving towards the project’s ultimate goals.

In a real-world context, consider a data science project aimed at creating a recommendation engine for an e-commerce website. The MVP might be a simple system that recommends products based on a user's recent browsing history. Scoping the project would involve identifying data requirements (e.g. user browsing history, product details), defining the recommendation algorithm to be used, and setting the objectives of the system (e.g., increase average purchase value, increase user engagement). The roadmap would lay out the steps from data collection to deploying the engine and continuously monitoring and updating it based on user feedback.

### Data Science Detailed **Example: Predicting House Prices**

Let's consider a hypothetical data science project in more detail where the objective is to create a model that predicts housing prices based on a variety of features to better understand how MVP, scoping, and roadmapping work together.

**Understanding the MVP**

In the context of a house pricing project, the MVP could be a simple model that predicts house prices based on their square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location and age of the house. 

This MVP is intentionally basic - it will not have all the features that the final model might have. For example, at the MVP stage, the model won't consider other potentially important factors such as the the overall state of the real estate market. These features could all potentially have a significant impact on the house price, and they would be considered for inclusion as you refine the model beyond the MVP.

However, by starting with an MVP, you are able to quickly get a usable product that can provide value and form the basis for further iterations and improvements. It's a way of ensuring that you are on the right track before you invest a lot of time and resources into developing more complex features and capabilities.

**Project Scoping**

For this project, you would first define your objectives clearly: to predict house prices based on a range of property features. Next, you identify the data requirements, such as property features (square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, age of the house, etc.) and the historical selling prices of the houses.

You also need to scope out the project's key features, which might include data cleaning and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, model development, model testing, and eventually, model deployment.

Prioritizing the steps, you'd start with data cleaning and wrangling, then exploratory data analysis, and lastly, model development. The constraints might include the data collection timeframe, computational resources, or the deadline for the model's completion.

When defining a project scope, it's crucial to identify what is included in the project (the "in scope" items) and what isn't included (the "out of scope" items). This helps ensure that the project doesn't expand beyond its original intent (scope creep).

In the context of the house pricing project, here are some examples of items that might be considered out of scope:

- **Collecting Additional Data:** While it might be interesting to include data on the neighborhood's average income or crime rate, or the property's proximity to amenities such as parks, schools, or shopping centers, gathering and integrating this information may be time-consuming and may not significantly improve the model's predictive power. Unless there's clear evidence that these factors are vital, these additional data may be considered out of scope for this project.
- **Creating a Web Interface or Mobile Application:** While having a user-friendly interface to input property features and display predicted prices might enhance usability, designing and building this interface is a separate, complex project in itself, which requires a different set of skills beyond data science. Thus, it may be considered out of scope for this project.
- **Including Commercial Properties:** The original project scope focuses on predicting prices for residential properties. Including commercial properties in the model would require additional data and might complicate the model, as commercial property prices are affected by different factors. Therefore, commercial properties would be considered out of scope for this project.

**Roadmap**

After scoping, you would create a roadmap. The roadmap for your project might look like this:

- Week 1: Data collection – gathering all necessary data, such as property features and selling prices.
- Week 2: Data cleaning and wrangling – handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect entries.
- Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis – understanding the data, identifying patterns, and looking for any correlations.
- Week 4: MVP Model development – creating a basic model to predict house prices.
- Week 5: Collecting feedback and iterating the model - refining the model based on feedback and adding more variables.
- Week 6-7: Full model development – building a comprehensive model that considers multiple features.
- Week 8: Model testing and validation – evaluating the model's performance and fine-tuning it for better accuracy.
- Week 9: Model Deployment – implementing the model in a real-world setting.
- Week 10 and beyond: Monitoring and updating the model – ensuring the model remains effective over time, updating it as necessary.

## Summary

In summary, adopting an MVP mindset, accurately scoping your project, and designing a roadmap are all crucial steps in turning a data analytics idea into reality. By providing a structure and strategic plan, these tools can increase a project's chances of success and effectiveness in achieving its goals.
