# Final Project Brief: End to End Data Analytics Project


## Introduction

Welcome to your final project! The goal of this project is for you to apply your data science or data analytics skills that you learned throughout the bootcamp by completing an end-to-end analysis on a real-world dataset. The project will also assist you in demonstrating your proficiency in the skills required for your desired career path and developing your portfolio to showcase your abilities to potential recruiters

If you're struggling to come up with a topic, we have provided a list of datasets for you to consider. However, we highly recommend that you explore and select a topic and dataset that personally interests you, as this will make the project more engaging and rewarding.

## Setup

For this project, you have the option to work either individually or in pairs, depending on your interests and goals. If you and a partner share a common interest and have ambitious plans for what you want to achieve, working in pairs is a great way to collaborate and tackle more complex challenges. However, please note that if you choose to work in pairs, we expect a higher level of output and quality.

## Project Brief

You may select one of two case studies, each designed to focus on specific skills and cater to your interests and career aspirations. This will enable you to tailor the project to your individual needs and provide a valuable learning opportunity that aligns with your long-term goals.

### Case Study 1: Data Science End to End Project

The goal of this case study is to build, on top of a business case, a predictive model in Python.

This project will require you to select a business case of your choice and iterate through the whole data science process, by doing data collection, data cleaning and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, preprocessing, model selection, evaluation and data visualization. The project should be structured as a complete pipeline that includes every step of the process.

### Case Study 2: Data Analytics End to End Project

The goal of this case study is to carry out data analysis and build a dashboard for decision making, using mainly SQL, some Python, and a visualization tool such as Tableau or Power BI.

This project will require you to select a business case of your choice and apply the full data analysis process to it, from data collection, data cleaning and wrangling, feature engineering, statistical analysis, to data visualization and dashboards. The project should be structured as a complete pipeline that includes every step of the process.

## Prerequisites

In order to successfully complete the final project, you should possess a strong understanding of several key concepts, including Python programming, data wrangling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), as required for previous projects/mini project. In addition to these, the following are essential prerequisites that you should have before beginning this final project:

### Case Study 1: Data Science End to End Project

- Unsupervised Models, such as KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering and PCA.
- Strong understanding of the most appropriate metrics and preprocessing techniques based on the specific problem and context.
- Experience with model enhancement iteration.

**Nice to have prerequisites:**

- Time Series

- Visualization tools such as Tableau or Power BI

## Typical Day

The daily schedule will change depending on whether it is week 8 or week 9:

- Week 8:
    - 9:00 - 13:00: Lessons/Class Activity
    - 14:00 - 15:00: Lab/Group Activity or Project Time
    - 15:00 - 18:00 Project time
    
    Or:
    
    - Project time: All day
- Week 9:
    - Project time: All day

## Getting Started

- Project Planning:
    - Create a Kanban or Trello Board for progress tracking and objective management.
    - Utilize data from previous projects, if available.
- Problem Selection and Data Gathering:
    - Select a business problem to address.
    - Locate and gather necessary data.
    - Explore and understand each field in the dataset.
- Data Analysis:
    - Apply statistical techniques and data visualization to examine feature relationships.
    - Make informed guesses about features requiring further investigation.
- Data Cleaning and Manipulation:
    - Handle outliers and missing values.
    - Perform type casting and feature selection.
    - Convert categorical data to numerical.
    - Use statistical methods for data analysis.
- Machine Learning (If applicable):
    - Apply machine learning on the objective variable data for prediction, classification, clustering, etc.
    - Experiment with different models and hyperparameters.
    - Choose the simplest effective model.
    - Clearly define the metric for evaluating "best" results.
- Presentation of Findings:
    - Present a statistical summary and data visualizations.
    - For non-machine learning projects:
        - Create a database for data storage.
        - Use SQL for data analysis.
        - Incorporate a dashboard for decision-making.

## Deliverables

You must submit the following deliverables in order for the project to be deemed complete:

- A new repo on your Github account.
    - Working code that meets all technical requirements, built by you.
        - Jupyter Notebook, Python, SQL files, Tableau/PowerBI report, or any additional needed files for your work
    - A README with the completed project documentation.
    - The URL of the slides for your project presentation.
- **Presentation:** when presenting your work, there are many important factors to consider, such as the content of your presentation and the way you deliver it. The following link offers valuable advice on how to make a strong presentation: [Presentations.](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/project-briefs-and-rubric/blob/main/DA%20Presentations.pdf)
- Paste your own repo's link in the Student Portal Project Activity

## Rubric

In order to assess your project and ensure all requirements are met, a **rubric** will be used. This rubric is used to **evaluate your project** by your teaching staff but also to **communicate** what constitutes incomplete, acceptable and excellent performance across each of the learning outcomes for the project. Take some time to review the rubric in the card in Student Portal and ask your teaching team any questions about it if necessary.

## Optional Advanced Features

While completing the basic requirements of your project is a great start, taking advantage of some advanced features can really take your work to the next level. Here are some options to consider if you want to go above and beyond.

- Use sophisticated methods for data cleaning such as handling missing or noisy data with advanced techniques such as Machine Learning algorithms.
- Use advanced techniques for handling unbalanced data (if needed)
- Considering time series analysis if applicable
- If using Machine Learning:
    - Implement more complex and sophisticated models, such as neural networks, NLP, advanced time series techniques.
    - Use of stacking techniques to combine multiple models to improve the predictions.
    - Use of advanced feature engineering techniques such as dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), and advanced feature selection methods.

Deployment of the model to a web application or cloud service.

## Presentations

You are free to present your final project in the way that you feel best represents your work. The contents will depend on whether your project will be Case Study 1 or Case Study 2, but in both cases it is important you communicate a compelling story about how you set about the project, the techniques used, insights gained and key learnings.
